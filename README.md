# xnat-jupyter-notebooks

This repository currently contains sample notebooks for use in the XNAT/Jupyter integrated environment. Head to [xnat-docker-compose/features/jupyterhub](https://github.com/NrgXnat/xnat-docker-compose/tree/features/jupyterhub) for information on setting that up.


You will also find notebooks used for the Jupyter demonstration during the XNAT Workshop in London 2022.
